## Story

### Title: A MAZE!

In a land where magic and reality intertwine, a brave hero known as HumanCat finds himself trapped in a mystical maze. HumanCat, a half-human, half-cat being, possesses agility and intelligence beyond imagination. The maze, with its high grass walls and hidden secrets, challenges all who dare to enter. 

Guided by the player, HumanCat must navigate through this intricate labyrinth, collecting magical coins that shimmer with ancient power. However, the true test lies in finding the mystical key hidden somewhere within the maze. Only this key can unlock the door at the end of the maze, granting HumanCat his freedom.

The player uses their phone to physically move around the maze, viewing it from different angles and guiding HumanCat using a virtual joystick. As the player and HumanCat explore, they must be wary of dead ends and cunning traps. The journey is perilous, but with determination and wit, the player can lead HumanCat to victory.
